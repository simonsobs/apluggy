name: Run unit tests with oldest dependency versions
# This workflow runs the unit tests with the oldest versions of the
# dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`. The oldest versions are specified in
# `ci/minimum/requirements.txt`. The `requirements.txt` file is needs to
# be manually updated to be aligned with `pyproject.toml`.
# 
# In the future, `pip` might be able to install the minimum versions in
# `pyproject.toml` directly as disscussed in an open issue:
# https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8085
